# Kingdom Massage 
### Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
___
This is a website for Kingdom Massage located in Edinburgh and owned by Laura Gemmell. The website highlights the health and sports injury treatments that Kingdom Massage offers, including the background history for Laura Gemmell and contact details to arrange a treatment. 

### UX
___
The design goal for the website was to make a contemporary spacious page that had a clear clutter free layout to display the information easily to vistors. The website colour scheme of purple hues links with the Kingdom Massage logo that represents a thistle.

The about section highlights the background history of Laura Gemmell, showing the origins from her sporting career to becoming a working mother and the training undertaken to become a massage therapist. A potrait image was used of Laura to show a more personal touch.

For potential clients, it was important to detail the large number of treatments that Kingdom Massage offers. Each treatment had to be described but had to be shown in a clear user friendly layout that was achieved with an accordian layout scheme, that only displays the information for the treatment selected. 

It was a requirement to provide contact details for Kingdom Massage and also the opportunity to allow clients to send a message for further information or to arrange a treatment. Social media links were also provided at the footer of the page encouraging clients to follow Kingdom Massage on Facebook and Twitter.

### Technologies
___
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (v4.3)
4. Javascript

### Features
___
This site uses a fixed top Bootstrap 4 navbar with a brand logo on the left and collapse menu on the right that is response to media size. An accordion is used for the treatments section as it was ideal to toggle between hiding and showing large amount of content. Javascript is used to enable the collapse features of the navbar and the accordion.

##### Features to Implement
In the future, I would like to add further javascript to the Navbar while using small/medium media when the navbar is epanded that it collapses the menu when a link is clicked. I would also like to add a price section to the website that will also allow the user the option to buy gift certificates.

An input form has been created in the contact section to allow potential clients to send Kingdom Massage a message with the senders details. The front end of the form has only been created, but the backend coding using PHP to send the message has to be developed.  


### Testing
___
The navbar for the site was to be fixed to top of screen and i wanted to minimse its screen space when viewed on mobile and tablet devices. To achieve this a toggle was used to hide the nav menu on these smaller screen sizes. This feature was tested at all screen sizes and the fixed top navbar allowed quick and easy access to these nav links at all times.

The about section was used to detail  Laura's history in becoming a massage therapist and the ongoing training undertaken. Viewing on desktop and tablet devices I wanted to include a potrait image of Laura but felt that this added uneccesary clutter when viewed on mobile devices and wanted this to be hidden. This feature was tested at all device media sizes.

It was neccessary to list all the treatments that Kingdom Massage offers. An accordian feature was succesfully used to hide the detail description with an image for each treatment until a user choose to view the treatment. For phone users the treatment image was deemed unecessary and added clutter, this was hidden when viewed at this screen size. This accordion was tested at all screen sizes.

The Contact section included address details for Kingdom Massage and a user form to allow a message to be sent for further details or to arrange an appointment. A nested grid layout was used to display at tablet and desktop screen sizes this information side by side in two columns, but at smaller phone sizes it was best to only display each col at the full screen view. This was tested and clearly displayed the info as intended at the differet screen sizes.

The user form was tested to ensure that all fields were completed and displayed an error message if not. The form also was tested to ensure that the user can only enter numbers and symbols for the phone field and must enter a valid email address before the user can submit the input otherwise an error message will be displayed.
