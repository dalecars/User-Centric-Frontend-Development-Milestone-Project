                                <p>The aim here is to get to the source of an ailment not just the accompanying symptoms. The techniques used (including trigger point and myofascial release) help reduce muscular tension and bring the muscles back into balance with a reduction in pain and
                                    an improvement in range of movement.</p>
                                <p>It reduces the likelihood of injury and if it does occur, the healing process is quickened. It involves the manipulation of the soft tissues of the body such as muscles, fascia, ligaments and tendons which can become damaged, impaired, knotted, tense
                                    or immobile.</p>

                                <p>Reflexology is based on the theory that different points on the feet, lower leg, hands, face and ears correspond to different areas on the body.  It’s main aim is to help release stress which in turn will help the body heal and regenerate.  This is achieved through the central nervous system which signals the body to adjust tension levels and aims to enhance overall relaxation and potentially bring internal organs and their systems into a state of optimum functioning.</p>
                                <p>Another bonus for reflexology is that it can be received by anyone of any age.  The therapist uses unique micromovement techniques with the goal of creating a positive response on the circulatory, respiratory, endocrine, immune and neuropeptide systems.</p>

                                <p>This is a traditional Chinese technique which involves physical pressure being applied to acupoints (common to both acupressure and acupuncture) using the fingertips, hand and elbow. It is a rejuvenating massage for the back, neck, shoulders, arms, hands and scalp. When the acupoints are pressed they release muscular tension and promote the circulation of blood, stimulating the bodies natural self-curative abilities.</p>
                                <p>Acupressure stengthens resistance to disease and promotes wellness by concentrating on areas most affected by prolonged repetitive work. It continues to be the most effective method for tension-related ailments by using the power and sensitivity of the human hand.</p>

                                <p>Slavic is the heart and soul of aromatherapy and takes it right back to its origins. It is a peaceful, harmonising massage that helps you drift into a dreamlike state using circular, flowing movements which are deeply relaxing. The warm blend of oil used
                                    is ideal for relieving muscle tension and stress aiming to stimulate and relax, pull and support. It’s by this working in duality over every part of the body that rebalances the body’s own natural rhythms.</p>

                                <p>Reiki is a Japanese healing art.  Its literal translation is ‘universal energy’ and in reality is the transmission of healing energy through the hands of the practitioner.  The energy known as ‘Ki’ flows through all living things and is vital to well being. The aim of the treatment is to rebalance these energy fields in and around the body to attempt to harmonise and bring relief to a wide range of physical, emotional and mental afflictions.</p>

                                     for a private room. Conferences and events are ideal where it is often a welcomed break for tired delegates in need of a pick-me-up!</p>

                        <div class="profile-history">
                            <p>I originally hail from Banbridge, Northern Ireland and have lived in Scotland since 2001, now residing in Carnock.
                            All my life i have been a keen sports person including Tae Kwon Do, badminton, golf and hockey. Now being a working mother I fully 
                            understand the day to day stress and tension a body can suffer.</p>
                            <div class="collapse" id="collapseLaura">
                                <p>On recognising the aches and pains I suffered myself during sport, work and pregnancy I decided to take up the challenge and learn massage therapy. 
                                After completing and thoroughly enjoying therapeutic massage training, I also mastered the on-site and sports/remedial massage challenges. It was after 
                                the completion of these that I realised how versatile massage actually is and how often small adjustments to lifestyle in addition to massage can help 
                                bring the mind and body back into balance.</p>
                                
                                <p>After finishing my training with Scottish Massage Schools I've continued to develop my professional skills by studying techniques in Hot Stones, 
                                Slavic and Emmett therapies. I am also a member of Scottish Massage Therapists Organisation (SMTO).</p>

                            <p>Hi I’m Vickie McCraw DIR DOSM and am excited to bring Reflexology to the Kingdom Massage repertoire.  I’m born and 
                            bred in Edinburgh and now reside in my hometown with my hubby and 3 sons.  I have a full life as a mum, housewife and 
                            general taxi driver to endless activities such as golf, footie, swimming etc.</p>

                                <p>After completing my Swedish Massage training many years ago, I tried a taster session in Reflexology and was instantly 
                                hooked! Knowing that this was the direction I wanted to head in, I spared no time in studying the discipline and gaining 
                                experience.  I find reflexology and the outcome it can produce very rewarding and have been thrilled with the feedback 
                                received from my clients.</p>
                                
                                <p>Hopefully the passion I have for both massage and reflexology reflects through my work as the role they can play in 
                                taking care of ourselves both mentally and physically can be life changing.</p>
