                    <p>I originally hail from Banbridge, Northern Ireland and have lived in Scotland since 2001, now residing in Carnock.
                    All my life i have been a keen sports person including Tae Kwon Do, badminton, golf and hockey. Now being a working mother I fully 
                    understand the day to day stress and tension a body can suffer.</p>
                        
                    <p>On recognising the aches and pains I suffered myself during sport, work and pregnancy I decided to take up the challenge and learn massage therapy. 
                    After completing and thoroughly enjoying therapeutic massage training, I also mastered the on-site and sports/remedial massage challenges. It was after 
                    the completion of these that I realised how versatile massage actually is and how often small adjustments to lifestyle in addition to massage can help 
                    bring the mind and body back into balance.</p>
                        
                    <p>After finishing my training with Scottish Massage Schools I've continued to develop my professional skills by studying techniques in Hot Stones, 
                    Slavic and Emmett therapies. I am also a member of Scottish Massage Therapists Organisation (SMTO).</p>

                                    <p>The aim here is to get to the source of an ailment not just the accompanying symptoms. The techniques used (including trigger point and myofascial release) help reduce muscular tension and bring the muscles back into balance with a reduction in pain and
                                        an improvement in range of movement.</p>
                                    <p>It reduces the likelihood of injury and if it does occur, the healing process is quickened. It involves the manipulation of the soft tissues of the body such as muscles, fascia, ligaments and tendons which can become damaged, impaired, knotted, tense
                                        or immobile.</p>
                                    <p>This deep tissue massage not only suits sports people but anyone who suffers with chronic conditions such as back pain, sciatica, arthritis, headaches/migraines, repetitive strain injuries such as tennis and golfers elbow, frozen shoulder etc.</p>
                                    <p>People from all walks of life and of all ages may benefit from this treatment.</p>

                                    <p>Reflexology is based on the theory that different points on the feet, lower leg, hands, face and ears correspond to different areas on the body.  Itâ€™s main aim is to help release stress which in turn will help the body heal and regenerate.  This is achieved through the central nervous system which signals the body to adjust tension levels and aims to enhance overall relaxation and potentially bring internal organs and their systems into a state of optimum functioning.</p>
                                    <p>Another bonus for reflexology is that it can be received by anyone of any age.  The therapist uses unique micromovement techniques with the goal of creating a positive response on the circulatory, respiratory, endocrine, immune and neuropeptide systems.</p>

It is a rejuvenating massage for the back, neck, shoulders, arms, hands and scalp. When the acupoints are pressed they release muscular tension and promote the circulation of blood, stimulating the bodies natural self-curative abilities.</p>

                                    <p>Reiki is a Japanese healing art.  Its literal translation is â€˜universal energyâ€™ and in reality is the transmission of healing energy through the hands of the practitioner.  The energy known as â€˜Kiâ€™ flows through all living things and is vital to well being. The aim of the treatment is to rebalance these energy fields in and around the body to attempt to harmonise and bring relief to a wide range of physical, emotional and mental afflictions.</p>
